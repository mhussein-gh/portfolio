        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Chocolate pound cake is a rich, moist, and dense but tender loaf cake—a chocolatey perfection! It’s 
            made with pantry staples, and it’s super speedy and easy to whip up (no electric mixer required 
            here). I hope it will become a staple in your household as a perfect any day treat. </p>
        <p>I love a slice of this pound cake with my beloved morning coffee. It also satisfies my after-dinner 
            sweets craving. Recently, I poked a few (yes, just a few!) candles on top to celebrate my 
            chocolate-loving mother’s birthday. I will be baking it over and over again.</p>

            <li>2 sticks (226g) unsalted butter, melted</li>

            <li>2 large eggs, at room temperature</li>
            <li>1 1/4 cups (201g) all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1/3 cup (35g) unsweetened natural cocoa powder</li>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Preheat the oven and prepare the pan:</strong> <br>
                Preheat the oven to 350°F. Spray an 8 1/2 x 4 1/2-inch loaf pan with nonstick cooking spray. 
                Line the pan with parchment paper, leaving a 2-inch overhang on two of the sides. 
                Set it aside.</li>
            <li><strong>Melt the chocolate:</strong> <Br>
                Place the espresso powder and 3/4 cup (163g) chocolate chips in a large bowl. Pour in the 
                boiling water and let it sit for 5 minutes. Then, whisk together until smooth.</li>
            <li><strong>Add the wet ingredients:</strong><Br>
                Whisk in the brown sugar, melted butter, vegetable oil, and vanilla until smooth. Add the 
                eggs and whisk until fully combined.</li>
            <li><strong>Mix the dry ingredients:</strong> <br>
                Set a sifter or fine mesh sieve over a medium bowl. Add the flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, 
                and salt, and sift. Whisk to combine.</li>
            <li><strong>Combine the wet and dry ingredients:</strong><br>
                Use a rubber spatula to fold the flour mixture into the chocolate mixture until just combined.</li>
            <li><strong>Add chocolate chips:</strong><br>
                Fold in the remaining 3/4 cup (163g) chocolate chips. </li>
            <li><strong>Bake the pound cake:</strong> <br>
                Scrape the batter into the prepared loaf pan. Bake until the loaf has risen and cracked a bit on
                 the top, 65 to 75 minutes. A toothpick inserted into the center should come out with just a few  
                moist crumbs, but no wet batter.</li>
            <li><strong>Cool and serve the pound cake:</strong><br>
                Remove the pan from the oven and set it on a wire rack to cool for about 1 hour. Use the parchment 
                sling to lift the loaf out. Slice and serve at room temperature.</li>
