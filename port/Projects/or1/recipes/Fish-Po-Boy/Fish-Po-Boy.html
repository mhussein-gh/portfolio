            in sandwich bread. The bread is stuffed with crispy cornmeal crusted fish, fresh 
            chopped lettuce, thick tomato slices, dill pickles, and a remoulade sauce that 
            has all of the spice and some texture from celery and relish.</p>

        <p>You can lay out the fried fish, lettuce, tomatoes, condiments in a little jar, 
            and allow people to create their own fish po' boys. Serve it with a bowl of 
            chips and dip or even a simple side salad and you’re all set. Traditionally, 
            it is served with French fries. Your options are endless.</p>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Set a baking rack over a sheet pan and set aside</li>
            <li><strong>Make the remoulade sauce:</strong><br>
                In a small bowl, combine the mayonnaise, heavy cream, garlic powder, 
                hot sauce, sweet relish, Slap Ya Mama seasoning, paprika, mustard, 
                horseradish, green onions, celery, and cayenne pepper. Taste and add more 
                cayenne pepper, if desired. Set aside until ready to use.</li>
            <li><strong>Set up dredging station:</strong><br>
                In a large bowl, combine the cornmeal, Cajun seasoning, and cayenne pepper. In another large bowl 
                whisk to combine the eggs and water. <br>
                Set the two bowls side by side. You will start with the cornmeal mixture.</li>
            <li><strong>Dredge the fish:</strong><br>
                Dip both sides of the fish into cornmeal mixture. Then, dip the fish into the egg mixture and 
                let any excess drip off. Dip the fish back into the cornmeal mixture and coat both sides for a 
                double coating. Set the breaded fish on the sheet pan lined with a baking rack until you are 
                ready to fry. Repeat until all of the fish is coated.</li>
            <li><strong>Preheat the oil:</strong><br>
                Fill a large Dutch oven (or a heavy skillet) with at least 3 inches of oil in your pot and heat 
                over medium-high heat, until the oil reaches 350°F on a thermometer.</li>
            <li><strong>Fry the fish:</strong><br>
                Carefully put each fish filet into the hot oil. Fry the fish, until golden brown and crisp, 
                roughly 3 to 4 minutes on each side, flipping halfway through cooking. This time can vary 
                depending on the thickness of your fish, but you will be able to tell by the golden color on 
                the outside.</li>
            <li><strong>Assemble your sandwiches:</strong><br>
                Split open the French bread. Slather the remoulade on the inside of both sides of the bread. 
                Layer the bread with lettuce, pickles, tomatoes, sliced onions, and fried fish. Assemble the 
                remaining sandwiches. Cut sandwiches into desired portions.</li>
            <li><strong>Serve:</strong><br>
                Serve fish po’ boys with fries, chips, or a salad!</li>
