            <a href="https://boxrec.com/en/box-pro/741718" target="_blank"><img src="week3_imgs/devin_haney.jpg" alt="Devin Haney" class="top1"></a>

            <div class="devininfo">
                <p>The top spot on my list goes to Devin Haney. Devin Haney is one of the first ever boxers I consistently started watching. His style is what impressed me the most. Although he may not be known for having much power in his punches, he still has a lot of skill.</p><br>
                <p>Once I saw him in action a couple of times I knew he would go on to accomplish great things in his weight division. Now just 5 months ago he went on to become the youngest undisputed world champion in the 4 belt era and joined the list of only 7 men as undisputed champion (in the 4 belt era).</p><br>
                <p>He is currently ranked NO.8 in the <a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/boxing/story/_/id/34979458/boxing-pound-pound-rankings-dmitry-bivol-keeps-winning-moving-devin-haney-earns-top-10-spot" target="_blank">ESPN Pound-For-Pound rankings</a>. </p>

            <h2>2. Shakur Stevenson</h2>
            <a href="https://boxrec.com/en/box-pro/790719" target="_blank"><img src="week3_imgs/shakur.jpg" alt="Shakur Stevenson" class="top2"></a>
            <figcaption>click image to view boxrec</figcaption>
            <div class="shakurinfo">
                <p>In at number 2 is Shakur Stevenson. He is my second favourite boxer purely because of his ability and unique style. He has completely dominated in his weight division and made the best of them look mediocre. Many people criticize him for his style and call it "boring", but I enjoy his style a lot.</p><br>
                <p>He recently lost both his WBC and WBO world titles on the scale since he was unable to make his contracted fight weight at 130lbs and he missed the weight by 1.6lbs. After missing weight he said his body could not handle cutting down to 130lbs and he will be moving up to 135lbs which is a much more competitive division with more exciting fights to make happen. So I can't wait so see what he does next.</p><br>
                <p>He is currently ranked NO.10 in the <a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/boxing/story/_/id/34979458/boxing-pound-pound-rankings-dmitry-bivol-keeps-winning-moving-devin-haney-earns-top-10-spot" target="_blank">ESPN Pound-For-Pound rankings</a> (but I predict one day he will be ranked NO.1).</p>

            <a href="https://boxrec.com/en/box-pro/352" target="_blank"><img src="week3_imgs/floyd.jpg" alt="Floyd Mayweather Jr" class="top3"></a>
            <figcaption>click image to view boxrec</figcaption>
            <div class="floydinfo">
                <p>Although I wasn't watching him when he used to fight back in the day, so I'm not able to really appreciate his legacy, but watching back his fights are so satisfying. His slick boxing and use of the philly shell style was amazing. Truly one of the best boxers of all time.</p><br>
                <p>He has mastered the art of "the sweet science" as they call it, and the ability to hit and not get hit. His ability to keep you at his range and pick his shots with such precision is almost unmatched. There isn't much you can criticize Mayweather on, after all, he is <strong><abbr title="The Best Ever">TBE</abbr></strong>.</p>

            <div class="wilderinfo">
                <p>Number 4 on my list goes to Deontay Wilder. Although I'm not the biggest fan of his style and boxing ability, or even his personality, I must admit it is always exciting to see Deontay Wilder in action. You never get a boring fight when Deontay Wilder steps through those ropes.</p><br>
                <p>He has got probably the most devistating one-punch knockout power in boxing in recent times. He has a 91.3% knockout rate. Only <a href="https://boxrec.com/en/box-pro/479205">Tyson Fury</a> was able to withstand his power, but even he got knocked down 4 times in their trilogy.</p>

            <figcaption>click image to view boxrec</figcaption>
            <div class="usykinfo">
                <p>Oleksandr Usyk is my 5th favourite boxer and NO.1 on my Pound-For-Pound list. He is fast with his hands and light on his feet, which is rare to see from a heavyweight, and his ring IQ is phenominal. I am also a fan of his personality even though he doesn't speak much English.</p><br>
                <p>Usyk was undisputed at Cruiserweight before he decided to move up to heavyweight. After a few fights at the division he got his first title shot and he flew all the way to London to give Anthony Joshua a boxing lesson in Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. After defeating Joshua and becoming the new unified champion, he made his first title defence against him in a rematch that took place in Saudi Arabia and beat him again.</p><br>
                <p>He is currently ranked NO.4 in the <a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/boxing/story/_/id/34979458/boxing-pound-pound-rankings-dmitry-bivol-keeps-winning-moving-devin-haney-earns-top-10-spot" target="_blank">ESPN Pound-For-Pound rankings</a>.</p>
